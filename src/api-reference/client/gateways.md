# oasis.gateways

## namespace

The ``oasis.gateways`` namespace provides objects implementing the ``OasisGateway`` interface, defining the client's backend used to send transactions to the Oasis network. It should be rare to need to directly implementthis interface; however, the definition is provided for those who'd like to implement it.

## OasisGateway

The **OasisGateway interface** is defined with the following TypeScript [source](https://github.com/oasislabs/oasis.js/blob/master/packages/service/src/oasis-gateway.ts).

In most cases, you should use one of the following two impementations: [Gateway](./developer-gateway) or [Web3Gateway](./web3-gateway).
