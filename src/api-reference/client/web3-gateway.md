# oasis.gateways.Web3Gateway

``oasis.gateways.Web3Gateway`` provides an implementation of ``OasisGateway`` that communicates with a web3 gateway.
It's suggested to use this package if you want the client to sign transactions with its own
wallet and specify transaction options like gas limit and additional authenticated data.

It currently only supports WebSockets and can be instantiated as follows:

## constructor

```javascript
let url = 'wss://web3.devnet.oasiscloud.io/ws';
let wallet = new oasis.Wallet(SECRET_KEY);

new oasis.gateways.Web3Gateway(url, wallet);
```

### Parameters

1. ``url`` - ``String``: The url of the gateway.
2. ``wallet`` - ``Wallet``: The wallet to sign transactions. For convenience, we package and suggest using the ethers.js `wallet`_.

::: tip
In addition to implementing the ``OasisGateway`` interface, the ``Web3Gateway`` exposes a subset of the
Web3 JSON RPC [spec](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC) along with Oasis extensions.

Supported namespaces are

* ``eth_``
* ``oasis_``
* ``net_``

#### Examples

To execute a web3 rpc method, simply access the namespace followed by the method.

For example, to retrieve the latest block using ``eth_getBlockByNumber``,

```
await gateway.eth.getBlockByNumber('latest', true);
```

To get the expiration of a given service using ``oasis_getExpiry``,

```
await gateway.oasis.getExpiry(address);
```

The full list of methods is specified below.

## eth.sendTransaction

In order to use this method, the ``Web3Gateway`` must be created with a ``Wallet``.
Note that this is slightly different from the canonical web3 eth_sendTransaction in that
the client will sign the transaction and convert it into an eth_sendRawTransaction before
sending it to the remote gateway.

### Parameters

1. Object - The transaction object

* to: ``String`` - (optional when creating new contract) The address the transaction is directed to.
* gas: ``String`` - (optional, default: 90000) Integer of the gas provided for the transaction execution. It will return unused gas.
* gasPrice: ``String`` - (optional) Integer of the gasPrice used for each paid gas
* value: ``String``  - (optional) Integer of the value sent with this transaction
* data: ``String`` - (optional) The data field of the transaction.
* nonce: ``String`` - (optional) Integer of a nonce. This allows to overwrite your own pending transactions that use the same nonce.

### Returns
``String`` - the transaction hash, or the zero hash if the transaction is not yet available.

Use :ref:`eth.getTransactionReceipt <getTransactionReceipt>` to get the contract address, after the transaction was validated, when you created a contract.

## eth.sendRawTransaction

### Parameters

`. ``String`` - The signed transaction data.

### Returns

``String`` - hex string of the 32 byte transaction hash, or the zero hash if the transaction is not yet available.

Use :ref:`eth.getTransactionReceipt <getTransactionReceipt>` to get the contract address, after the transaction was validated, when you created a contract.

## eth.call

Executes a transaction at the gateway without creating a transaction on the block chain.
Note that this feature is not available for confidential contracts, because Web3 gateways
don't have access to confidential state.

### Parameters

1. Object - The transaction call object

* from: ``String`` - (optional) The address the transaction is sent from.
* to: ``String`` -  when creating new contract) The address the transaction is directed to.
* gas: ``String`` - (optional, default: 90000) Integer of the gas provided for the transaction execution. It will return unused gas.
* gasPrice: ``String`` - (optional) Integer of the gasPrice used for each paid gas
* value: ``String``  - (optional) Integer of the value sent with this transaction
* data: ``String`` - (optional) The data field of the transaction.
* nonce: ``String`` - (optional) Integer of a nonce. This allows to overwrite your own pending transactions that use the same nonce.

### Returns

``String`` - hex string of the return value of the transaction

## eth.estimateGas

Estimates gas for a given transaction by executing a transaction at the gateway and recording the gas used.
The transaction is not added to the blockchain and so doesnt not affect state.
Note that this feature is not available for confidential contracts, because Web3 gateways
don't have access to confidential state.

### Parameters

1. Object - The transaction call object

* from: ``String`` - (optional) The address the transaction is sent from.
* to: ``String`` -  (optional) when creating new contract) The address the transaction is directed to.

* gasPrice: ``String`` - (optional) hex string of the gasPrice used for each paid gas
* value: ``String``  - (optional) hex string of the value sent with this transaction
* data: ``String`` - (optional) the data field of the transaction.
* nonce: ``String`` - (optional) hex stirng of a nonce. This allows to overwrite your own pending transactions that use the same nonce.

### Returns

``String`` - hex string of the amount of gas used for executing a transaction at the gateway.

## eth.getFilterLogs

Returns an array of all logs matching filter with given id.

### Parameters

1. ``String`` (hex) - The filter id.

### Returns

See :ref:`eth_getFilterChanges <getFilterChanges>`.

## eth.getLogs

Returns an array of all logs matching a given filter object.

### Parameters

``Object`` - The filter options:

* fromBlock: ``String`` - (optional, default: "latest") Integer block number, or "latest" for the last mined block or "pending", "earliest" for not yet mined transactions.
* toBlock: ``String`` - (optional, default: "latest") Integer block number, or "latest" for the last mined block or "pending", "earliest" for not yet mined transactions.

* blockhash: ``String`` (hex), 32 Bytes - (optional) With the addition of EIP-234 (Geth >= v1.8.13 or Parity >= v2.1.0), blockHash is a new filter option which restricts the logs returned to the single block with the 32-byte hash blockHash. Using blockHash is equivalent to fromBlock = toBlock = the block number with hash blockHash. If blockHash is present in the filter criteria, then neither fromBlock nor toBlock are allowed.

### Returns

See :ref:`eth_getFilterChanges <getFilterChanges>`.

## eth.subscribe

To make a web3 subscription use the ``eth_subscribe`` method. Unlike other RPCs,
instead of returning the server response, ``eth_subscribe`` will resolve to an
``EventEmitter`` object, emitting events on the ``data`` topic.

For example, to subscribe to logs,

```javascript
const subscription = await gateway.eth.subscribe('logs', {
  address: '0x...'
  topics: ['0x...']
});

subscription.on('data', (event) => {
  // Do something with your event.
});
```

To subscribe to new block headers,

```javascript
const subscription = await gateway.eth.subscribe('newHeads');

subscription.on('data', (event) => {
  // Do something with your block headers.
});
```

To unsubscribe, give the subscription id to the ``eth_unsubscribe`` method. Continuing the
above example,

```javascript
await gateway.eth.unsubscribe(subscription.id);
```

## net.version

none

### Returns

``String`` - the current network id.

* "1": Ethereum Mainnet
* "2": Morden Testnet (deprecated)
* "3": Ropsten Testnet
* "4": Rinkeby Testnet
* "42": Kovan Testnet
* ...
* "42261": Oasis Devnet

## oasis.getPublicKey

### Parameters
