# Overview

## What is the Oasis Network?

The Oasis Network is a privacy-first decentralized computing
network.

The Oasis Network separates consensus services from computation,
making the platform highly adaptable while enabling high-performance computation.
This unique design has two major core components, the Consensus Layer and
the ParaTime Layer.

* The Consensus Layer: The Consensus Layer is a decentralized set of validator
nodes that maintains a proof-of-stake blockchain.

* The ParaTime Layer: The ParaTime Layer can host multiple parallel runtimes, each
representing a replicated application with shared state. 

## Key Features

**Confidentiality**
The Oasis Network is designed to support end-to-end confidentiality and data
ownership, with built-in support for key management and TEEs like Intel SGX —
allowing it to support new privacy-preserving Dapps and services.

**Versatility & Resilience**
The Oasis Network is designed to support a broad range of use cases without
having to go through hard-forks or large updates — helping ensure it can retain
its value and utility for many years to come.

**Performance**
The Oasis Network separates computation from consensus and allows for ParaTimes
to operate in parallel — avoiding issues like computational backlog that have
plagued other networks.

## FAQ

#### Are you a proof-of-stake or proof-of-work platform?

Oasis is a proof-of-stake platform.

Unlike many other proof of stake networks however, we have a different architectural design that separates compute from consensus and allows the system to scale to support transactions with greater complexity than many traditional sharding platforms.

#### Is Oasis a unique platform or built on top of Ethereum?

Oasis is a unique Layer 1 platform and is not built on top of Ethereum.

To learn more about our platform read our [white paper](https://oasisprotocol.org/papers)!

#### How does this compare to a private blockchain like Hyperledger?

At Oasis our goal is to build a public decentralized network that offers additional properties of confidentiality and privacy for your data.

Conversely, Hyperledger is a siloed network typically run and owned by one entity that retains some of the properties often found in blockchain computing systems.

It does not support confidentiality across a public network.

#### When will you open source your code?

All code can be found at [https://github.com/oasisprotocol](https://github.com/oasisprotocol).

#### How can I become a node operator or a validator on Oasis Network?

The Oasis network is a proof of stake system and we’ll look to community members to run nodes for everything from storage to computation to consensus.

While our network is not quite ready for node operators, we should be getting there soon!

If you’re interested in signing up to run a node, please go to [https://oasisprotocol.org/node](https://oasisprotocol.org/node) and we’ll be in touch as soon as we’re ready.
