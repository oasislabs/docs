# Overview

The Internet is an amazing platform for innovation, creativity, and free expression. And yet despite its empowering design elements, the Internet has left individual’s with little control or ownership over personal data.

We believe in building new technology that can give us a better Internet experience. One that transforms “users” into edge clients, and enables them to take back control of their data, and their digital experiences.  One that fully respects individual privacy and autonomy, while still supporting amazing apps and services.

## What is the Oasis Network?

The Oasis Network is a proof-of-stake privacy-first, decentralized computational network. 

The Network is designed to overlay the Internet and give users back control of their data, while supporting new privacy-first applications and use-cases. In order to do this, the Oasis Network is designed to provide four critical properties: 
* Confidentiality & integrity guarantees of data in storage, transit and usage
* Auditability of state through a decentralized network
* Versatility of system architecture to adapt and support the full breadth of use-cases on the internet	
* Utility and performance required to support real-world work loads

The Oasis Network achieves these four properties through a unique design that separates consensus from computation, while providing a built-in interface for privacy-preserving computation — we call these two components the Consensus layer and the ParaTime layer. Unlike other blockchains, the Oasis Network is unique in its ability to support multiple, parallel runtimes — with the Consensus Layer acting as a hub and decentralized ledger for all runtimes. This structure allows the network to remain incredibly nimble and support specialized computation needs, while still providing strong integrity of actions and a distributed, immutable ledger. 

### FAQ

#### Are you a proof-of-stake or proof-of-work platform?

Oasis is a proof-of-stake platform.

Unlike many other proof of stake networks however, we have a different architectural design that separates compute from consensus and allows the system to scale to support transactions with greater complexity than many traditional sharding platforms.

#### Is Oasis a unique platform or built on top of Ethereum?

Oasis is a unique Layer 1 platform and is not built on top of Ethereum or any other protocol.

To learn more about our platform read our [white paper](https://oasisprotocol.org/whitepapers)!

#### How does this compare to a private blockchain like Hyperledger?

At Oasis our goal is to build a public decentralized network that offers additional properties of confidentiality and privacy for your data.

Conversely, Hyperledger is a siloed network typically run and owned by one entity that retains some of the properties often found in blockchain computing systems.

It does not support confidentiality across a public network.

#### When will you open source your code?

All code can be found at [https://github.com/oasisprotocol](https://github.com/oasisprotocol).

#### How can I become a node operator or a validator on Oasis Network?

The Oasis network is a proof of stake system and we’ll look to community members to run nodes for everything from storage to computation to consensus.

While our network is not quite ready for node operators, we should be getting there soon!

If you’re interested in signing up to run a node, please go to [https://oasisprotocol.org/node](https://oasisprotocol.org/node) and we’ll be in touch as soon as we’re ready.
