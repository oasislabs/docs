# Oasis Network Incentives: A Proposal for the Network at Time of Launch

::: tip NOTE
This is a draft proposal and is subject to change pending the outcome of an
economic audit, feedback from the community, and the results of the Oasis
Foundation’s staking competition.
:::

Below is a proposal of the initial incentive model for the Oasis Network at the
time of Mainnet launch. To submit your feedback and comments to the proposal
please reach out to us on [Slack] or via [GitHub][github-docs].
When designing and running stress tests, audits, and simulations, the
underlying goal has been to develop an incentive model that encourages both the
development of a healthy and active developer ecosystem as well as a secure,
decentralized network through an engaged and diverse node operator community.

The core focus of this incentive documentation is to outline a proposal for
parameters and rewards around staking and delegation.
In future documentation we will provide more detail on the proposed roadmap and
rewards that expand beyond this activity.

_Note that following network launch, all changes to the protocol will be
determined by the community based on the consensus mechanism of the Oasis network._

## Summary

* **Estimated staking rewards**: 15% annual rewards at launch, tapering to 10%
  by end of year.
* **Slashing**: Slash for double-signing only
* **Number of validators to participate in any given consensus committee (and
  receive staking rewards) at launch**: up to 100 validators
* **Minimum stake**: 100 tokens

## Overview of the Oasis Consensus Layer

The Oasis Network is based on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model. Tokens
can be self-delegated directly by each node operator or delegated to a node
operator by other token holders. While the Oasis Network is designed with a
modular architecture that can use any consensus system that satisfies these
properties, it currently uses [Tendermint] as its consensus algorithm.

At the time of the initial Mainnet launch, node operators will primarily serve
as validators for this consensus layer. They will have the ability to sign
blocks, earn transaction fees, stake, and receive delegation. Similar to the
PoS design implemented by Cosmos, up to 100 validators with the most stake will
be active validators participating in the consensus process.

The system will disincentivize bad behavior via slashing for double-signing, as
well as via the cost to dominate the network, in terms of the number of staked
tokens.

## Nuts and Bolts of Staking Rewards

### Staking Conditions

As a public, permissionless blockchain platform, our goal is to make the
experience of setting up a node as seamless as possible for any member of our
community who wants to contribute to the Oasis Network. To that end, we’ve put
a lot of thought into ensuring our staking conditions minimize barriers to
entry and encourage meaningful engagement on the network. A few key parameters:

* **Number of validators to participate in consensus committee (and receive
  staking rewards) at launch**: Up to 100 validators

* **Minimum stake**: 100 tokens

* **Selection to the consensus committee**: Each entity can have at most one
  node elected to the consensus committee at a time. The probability of
  selection to the consensus committee is proportional to the stake of all
  nodes run by one entity.

* **Annual rewards**: The network is targeted to hit ~15% annual rewards at
  launch (based on the number of blocks produced, so timing could vary) and then
  taper down to 10% by end of year. This will happen over a gradual taper rather
  than a step function change to avoid creating some sort of cliff.

* **Slashing**: At the time of Mainnet launch, the network will only slash for
  double-signing. The network would slash the minimum stake amount (100 tokens)
  and freeze the node. Freezing the node is a precaution in order to prevent
  the node from being over-penalized. The Network will not slash for liveness
  or uptime at launch.

* **Staking rewards**: The goal initially is to offer rewards that will help
  bootstrap the network effectively. To start, rewards will be proportional to
  the stake and awarded on a per-entity basis. In order to be eligible for
  staking rewards per epoch, a node would need to sign at least 75% of blocks
  in that epoch.

* **Unbonding period**: The network will have a ~14 day unbonding period.
  During this time, staked tokens are at risk of getting slashed for
  double-signing and do not accrue rewards during this time.

* **Consensus Voting power**: During the staking competition, we plan to run
various tests to help us determine whether to distribute consensus voting power
on the network through a stake-weighted system or to leverage a non-weighted,
flat voting approach. Expect more here in the future.

### Delegation

As the Oasis Network gets closer to Mainnet, we’ll continue to share with our
community plenty of additional information on the delegation process and how to
do easily delegate on the network. In the meantime, here are a few thoughts on
delegation more generally:

* **Slashing**: Delegated funds can be slashed for double-signing.

* **Reward disbursement**: Rewards from delegated funds are distributed
  directly to the delegator. Rewards are automatically added to their stakes
  (i.e. reinvested), so the rewards will have to go through the ~14 day
  unbonding period.

### Commission Rates

There is currently no plan to require a minimum or maximum commission rate for
delegation, but we would like to set parameters around the transparency and
notification of commission rates.

When a node sets up on network, it will be able to share its current commission
rate, as well as the range with which that rate could change (e.g. + / - 10%).
Commission rates can be adjusted once per day.

### Transaction Fee Distribution

Most likely, transaction fees will be distributed equally among validators who
signed the block containing that specific transaction.

## Glossary of Commonly Used Terms

* **Entity**: That’s you! (Or your organization.) On the Oasis Network, you’re
identified by your public key. Your private key controls your wallet, which
maintains a token balance. Each entity can also have a token amount staked,
which is a separate balance that permits it to run *nodes*.
See [Entities and Key Management] for further information.

* **Node**: This is your computer (VM, bare metal, container, etc.), running
  the Oasis Network software. It’s identified by another public key, separate
  from your entity public key. On the Oasis Network, each node is owned by a
  single entity. For each node that an entity registers on the network, the
  entity must have a certain additional token amount *staked*.

* **Staking**: A token amount *staked* with an entity is separate from the
  entity’s token balance and contributes to the entity’s eligibility to run
  nodes. Entities can *stake* tokens with themselves or with other entities,
  the latter is referred to as *delegation*. The network keeps track of which
  entities delegated what proportion of an entity’s staked token amount.

* **Consensus committee**: The consensus committee is a group of nodes that the
  network elects to maintain its state by executing a Byzantine-fault-tolerant
  (BFT) consensus protocol.

* **Validator**: A validator is a node participating in the consensus
  committee. To be eligible to have your node selected as a validator, your
  entity must be within the Top K staked entities. Entities with a node serving
  as a validator receive *staking rewards*, which are shared with delegators,
  as well as *transaction fees*, which are deposited only into their own
  wallet. Each validator has a private key that is used for signing operations
  during block production and a public key, or Node Identity, used for
  identification. See [Entities and Key Management] for further information.

* **Top K**: The top-ranked entities by token amount staked. These entities’
  nodes are eligible to participate in the consensus committee and receive
  staking rewards.

* **Transaction fee**: The reward that a validator receives from processing a
  transaction that runs on the network (separate from staking rewards).

* **Commission rate**: The fee that a validator chooses to charge to
  delegators.

* **Unbonding period**: A period of time when a validator or delegator wants to
  stop staking tokens, but cannot move them. During this waiting period, tokens
  do not accrue staking rewards but cannot be withdrawn.
