# Community Node Program

The Community Node program making it easy to join the
[Oasis Amber Network](https://docs.oasis.dev/operators/amber-network.html)
as a Node Operator even if you're new to the network.

More info on the program below.

## Goal of the program

The Oasis Foundation set up this program in order to give
new teams an experience to run a node on the network, get involved
in the broader Oasis Network community and earn a chance to get a
delegation from the Foundation at Mainnet launch.

## How the program works

The program is pretty simple:

1. [Set up your node and create a public key](https://docs.oasis.dev/operators/running-node-on-amber-network.html#prerequisites)
2. Submit your details [here](https://oasisfoundation.typeform.com/to/Z0w1W2)
3. The Oasis Foundation will provide a small token delegation
and send you a notification when it’s done
4. [Register and run your node](https://docs.oasis.dev/operators/running-node-on-amber-network.html)
(skip instructions related to staking as you’ve been
delegated funds by the Foundation)
5. Join the #nodeoperators channel on [slack](www.oasisprotocol.org/slack)
and get help from other nodes
6. [File issues](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-core/issues/new/choose)
and help improve the Network

## Will I earn staking rewards

Please note that while the Foundation will provide a small delegation of tokens
to kick start your node, it may not be enough to get into the consensus committee
or earn staking rewards at first.

For Amber, the consensus committee size is currently set at 70 nodes, but as we
have more involvement from additional nodes like yourselves we may increase
the size in subsequent upgrades. This will also help inform what the consensus
committee size is at Mainnet launch.

For the time being, we hope this initial delegation will be enough to get started
on the network, test it out, and see how it works from a technical perspective.
