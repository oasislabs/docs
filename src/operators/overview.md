# Node Operator Overview

The Oasis Network's decentralized consensus layer is comprised of nodes operated
by independent Node Operators. This documentation is intended to assist any individual
or organization in participating in the network as a Node Operator.

If you run into any issues or have a question, you can chat with us in our
[public Slack channel][slack].
