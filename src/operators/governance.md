# The Oasis Network Governance

::: tip NOTE The proposed governance model is still
being finalized. Please check back for updates. If you
have a general question on how to use and deploy our
software, please read our Operator Docs or join our
community Slack. All community members are welcom

## Proposed Governance Model Overview

The Oasis Protocol Foundation proposes a representative democracy
governance model based on a combination of off-chain and on-chain
processes for the continued development of the Oasis Network. The
Oasis Protocol Foundation will be tasked with guiding the long-term
development of the platform and coordinating the community of
development and network operations, with input collected from
community members and changes to the network being voted on by
node operators, with voting power based proportionally on staked
and delegated tokens. We propose this model because we think it
will provide a balanced voice to all engaged community members
-- from developers of all sizes, to node owners, to token holders
-- while at the same time still facilitating the swift deployment
of network updates, new features, critical bug fixes.

In order for the community to balance distributed ownership and
participation with speed and quality of platform development, we
propose a hybrid model of off- and on-chain mechanisms, organized
around the following key components:

1. Minor Feature Requests
2. Major Feature Requests
3. Bug Fixes

## Minor Feature Requests

To request new functionality, there are two primary approaches
that will be most effective at receiving input and making
progress.

If the feature is small - a change to a single piece of
functionality, or an addition that can be expressed clearly
and succinctly in a few sentences, then the most appropriate
place to [propose it is as a new feature request] in this
repository.

## Major Feature Requests

If the feature is more complicated, involves protocol
changes, or has potential safety or performance implications,
then consider [proposing an ADR] and submit it as a pull request
ot this repository. This will allow a structured review and
commenting of the proposed changes. You should aim to get
the ADR accepted and merged before starting on implementation.
Please keep in mind that the project's committers still have
the final word on what is accepted into the project.

::: tip NOTE
We recommend that major protocol updates including a
need to hard fork, and roadmap and feature planning be conducted
with recommendations from the Oasis Foundation and its technical
advisory committee.
:::

Moving forward, our proposed process for reviewing
and approving major protocol updates is:

- **Proposals** for features and roadmap updates can
come from anyone in the community. These proposals
are agreed upon by committee and then shared with
the community and open for additional comments for
a minimum of 1 month.
- **Review / Comments period** where anyone can provide
input, comments, and suggestions. In the case of major
roadmap updates, a comment period would be 2 weeks;
for major bugs this would be 24 hours.
- **Technical steering committee approval.** If not
independently taken by any community member, the
technical steering committee can adopt the proposal
and, if feasible, assign an engineering team
(see [RFC process]).
- **Final vote for approval.** Once built, the community
votes to approve each upgrade and the corresponding
features that are included in the proposal. This
voting process may initially be done off-chain
but will eventually become an on-chain process.
Nodes in the validator set for the network’s
consensus model will vote to approve changes, with
each node’s voting power being proportional to their
share of tokens staked relative to the total tokens
staked in the validator set.
- **Upgrade.** Node operators autonomously upgrade their
system to run the new version of the software.

## Urgent Bug Fixes

Urgent bug fixes will primarily be handled off-chain
to optimize for speed in addressing any issues that
are critical to the immediate health of the network.
The Oasis Network community as a whole is collectively
responsible for identifying and addressing bugs. As
bugs are identified, the Oasis Protocol Foundation
can serve as a line of first defense to triage these
bugs and coordinate security patches for quick release.

Bugs are a reality for any software project. We
can't fix what we don't know about!

If you believe a bug report presents a security risk,
please follow [responsible disclosure] and report it
directly to [security@oasislabs.com] instead of filing
a public issue or posting it to a public forum.

We will get back to you promptly.

Otherwise, please, first search between [existing
issues in our repository] and if the issue is
not reported yet, [file a new one].
