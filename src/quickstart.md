# Quickstart

In this guide we will take you through setting up your Oasis dev environment, testing a simple Rust service using cargo, testing the same service using a locally running blockchain, and finally testing it using our Devnet 2.0.

If you run into any issues or have a question, you can chat with us in our public [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/oasiscommunity/shared_invite/enQtNjQ5MTA3NTgyOTkzLWIxNTg1ZWZmOTIwNmQ2MTg1YmU0MzgyMzk3OWM2ZWQ4NTQ0ZDJkNTBmMTdlM2JhODllYjg5YmJkODc2NzgwNTg).

## Set Up the Oasis SDK

### Install the Oasis Toolchain

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSL https://get.oasis.dev | python
```

Alternatively, pipe into `python - --help` to see installation options.

## Unit Test the "Hello World" Service Using Cargo

1. `git clone https://github.com/oasislabs/tutorials`
2. `cd tutorials/hello-world/service`
3. `oasis test -- --nocapture`

The test will do the following:

1. Retrieve "Hello World!" in Slovenian
2. Attempt to retrieve "Hello World!" in Samoan, but fail because it doesn't exist
3. Attempt to insert a duplicate greeting (this will fail)
4. Insert "Hello World!" in Samoan
5. Retrieve "Hello World!"" successfully in Samoan

You should see the following console output:

```
running 1 test
In Slovenian: "Pozdravljen, svet!"
In Samoan: None
Adding "Zeno World!" for "en"
Err(DuplicateEntry)
Adding "alofa fiafia i le lalolagi!" for "ws"
In Samoan: "alofa fiafia i le lalolagi!"
test tests::test_paths ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

Great!
Now that the tests pass, it's time build the service for deployment and test it on the local chain.

## Integration Test Using the Local Chain

In this step we will use the JavaScript-based test in the test directory.
This script uses [oasis.js](https://github.com/oasislabs/oasis.js) to interact with either the local chain or Devnet 2.0.

1. `oasis build`
2. `cd ../app`
3. Install app dependencies using `oasis build`
4. In a separate terminal, run the local chain using `oasis chain`

You can now test on the local chain using `oasis test`.
Note that the `app` tests will run when in a subdirectory of `app`. You will see the following output,

```
 PASS  test/service.spec.ts (5.965s)
  HelloWorld Test
    ✓ deployed (2ms)
    ✓ known greeting (409ms)
    ✓ insert new greeting in Samoan (400ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       3 passed, 3 total
```

## Deploy on Devnet 2.0

You can deploy your service to Devnet 2.0 using `oasis deploy`.
When you run that command, with any luck, you'll see something like the following:

```
   Deploying hello-world
         ...
    Deployed HelloWorld at 0xf8b476862dd4bcaaabb988aa5a459d95e319ac0e
```

You can now point an app at `0xf8b476862dd4bcaaabb988aa5a459d95e319ac0e` using the client's [Service.at](https://oasis-labs-oasis-client.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/service.html#service-at) constructor and interact with the spiffy decentralized backend you just deployed!
