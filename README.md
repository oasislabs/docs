These docs are hosted at [docs.oasis.dev](https://docs.oasis.dev) and are built using [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org).

## Contributing

You can help make these docs excellent by submitting issues and PRs for things that are unclear or need improvement.

Before submitting a pull request, make sure to run `npx markdownlint-cli src/`
and fix the reported Markdown issues.

When adding new files, be sure to add the paths to [this file](./src/.vuepress/config.js), otherwise the files will not be displayed.

## Generating the docs

To preview docs as you're editing them, run `cd src && npx vuepress dev`.
Please try to do this when creating large PRs.

Don't worry about building the docs (using `vuepress build`).
CI does this for you when your PR is merged, which means that small changes can be made directly from the web UI.
